A tinder clone mobile app that matches up people with users with shared interests.

Our tech stack: Developing our app with React-Native and we're using Firebase for database storage and authentication.

Table of Contents

Available Scripts
npm start
npm run ios
npm start

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the Expo app on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the --reset-cache flag to the start script:

npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
npm run ios

Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.
